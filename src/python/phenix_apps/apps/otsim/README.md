# OT-sim App

This app, named `ot-sim` aids in the generation of config files for
[OT-sim](https://ot-sim.patsec.dev). It currently supports generating
configuration files for three different types of devices: a field device
(`fd-server`), a front-end processor (`fep`), and a client (`fd-client`). It
also supports generating a start script for a HELICS broker if needed.

Below is an example of all the options available in the app, with documentation
for each.

```

          #   * base-fed-count
          # If both `hostname` and `address` are provided, `hostname`
          # takes precedence and the address for the broker will be pulled
          # from the topology. If `hostname` is provided it should include
          # the name of an interface in the topology to pull an IP from.
          # Otherwise, the first interface from the topology will be used.
          # If both `hostname` and `base-fed-count` are provided, an
          # inject will be generated and added to the topology for the
          # host to start the broker with the given number of federates
          # plus however many devices with I/O modules are configured. The
          # optional `log-level` and `log-file` options for the broker are
